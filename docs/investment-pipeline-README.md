## 💡 Tips for Success

### Data Quality

- Always verify download completion (check file sizes)
- Compare data ranges across sources for consistency
- Document any manual adjustments or exclusions

### Rate Limiting

- Zillow: Be respectful, add delays between requests
- BLS API: 500 requests/day limit (with key), 25 without
- Census: No strict limits but use reasonable delays

### Data Updates

- Zillow: Updates monthly (typically first week of month)
- Census: Annual updates (ACS in September)
- BLS: Monthly employment data, quarterly wages
- Re-run downloads quarterly for fresh data

### Storage

- Full dataset: ~500MB-1GB compressed
- Keep raw downloads separate from processed data
- Use version control for scripts, not data

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Download Failures

```bash
# Check internet connection
ping zillow.com

# Verify URLs are still valid (they occasionally change)
# Check Zillow Research page for updated links

# Try manual download if automated fails
```

### Missing Data

- Some smaller metros may not have all metrics
- Rural areas often excluded from certain datasets
- Use metro_reference.csv to verify coverage

### API Issues

```bash
# BLS API not working?
# 1. Verify API key is correct
echo $BLS_API_KEY

# 2. Check daily request limit
# 3. Try manual download as backup
```
